Hi people
I decide learn a new language and I choose flutter. so what is flutter? flutter is a sdk for front-end perpose but ofcourse it handle back-end too.
base of this sdk is Dart and this language is using for two part front and back -end. also flutter is a cross platform sdk it`s mean that you can write app
in a single main.dart file and compile it for mobile(android/ios), windows, and web platforms and this feature make it so usefull. another benefit is big package for anything you need in pub dev for flutter component and etc. so let`s learn.
please if is any point please tell me i willing to learn.
tnx
