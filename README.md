hi guys :)

I decided to learn a new stack-sdk and you know what is better choice than FLUTTER(dart). 
first what is flutter? 
flutter is a sdk for front-end perpose but ofcourse it handle back-end too.
base of that sdk is Dart and this language is using for two part, front and back -end.
also flutter is a cross platform sdk its mean that you can write app
in a single main.dart file and compile it for mobile(android/ios), windows, and web platforms and this feature make it so usefull.
another fun things do you guys heared about pub-dev? yeah its best thing ever i see.
I tell you go and start writing your app of any platform you want and dont be worry
pub-dev is here, yeah.
